# TriviaGame

A trivia game with a Zelda theme!

Deployed: https://sdreyes.github.io/TriviaGame/

Click "Start Game" to begin playing, and choose answers to the questions within the 30 second limit. After each question, it will let you know whether or not your answer was correct and a gif is displayed for 5 seconds before moving onto the next question. After all the questions are answered, your results will display on the screen and you will be offered a button to play the game again.

This is a project showing my skills in JQuery, HTML, and CSS.

Parameters of the project:

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
